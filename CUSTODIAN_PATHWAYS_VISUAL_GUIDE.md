# Custodian Pathways — Prospectus Visual Guide

> A practical, copy‑paste playbook for building the prospectus visuals, diagrams, and quotes in **Canva**.

**Quick assets**

* Strategy on a Page (PNG): **[CP_Strategy_On_A_Page.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/CP_Strategy_On_A_Page.png)**
* Quote Bank (CSV, tagged to Youth · Country · Futures): **[Custodian_Pathways_Quote_Bank.csv](sandbox:/mnt/data/Custodian_Pathways_Quote_Bank.csv)**

## 1) Brand platform (for consistent copy)

**Name:** Custodian Pathways
**Byline (primary):** *From potential to prosperity.*
**Stance (alt, bold):** *Not welfare. Not charity. Partnership.*

**Core pillars:** **Youth · Country · Futures**

* **Youth** — young people as leaders, not clients.
* **Country** — land & culture regenerated through real work.
* **Futures** — intergenerational wealth & justice savings.

> Your current prospectus already opens with "Our Why" and a "Reality" stats spread—retain that structure, tighten copy, and place one hero quote per spread.

## 5) Chart & graphic recipes (with copy‑paste CSV)

> Import these CSV snippets directly into **Canva → Apps → Charts → Import data**. Where relevant, numbers are grounded in your uploaded docs; adjust for the latest figures you decide to publish.

### R1. **Cost per day: Prison vs Community (QLD 2019–20)**

---

### R5. **Reality poster (from your Prospectus "Reality" page)**

Reoffending_rate,>85%,reoffend within 12 months

## 7) Diagram prompts (optional icon/pattern generation)

*(If you're using MidJourney or similar for icons/patterns—otherwise draw in Canva.)*

## 8) Page copy blocks (paste as is)

**Our Why (80–100 words)**
We are Custodian Pathways. We build futures that last. We create pathways where young people grow into leaders, land is regenerated, and communities prosper. This is not a program—it's a custodian economy: Youth · Country · Futures. We start with cultural safety and real work, we stay with people as mentors, and we return value to community. The system is broken—but we don't see problems. We see potential.

**The Ask**
**Join as shareholder, not donor.**

* **Capital:** Seed a learning centre or cohort.
* **Employment:** Cadetships, placements, long‑term roles.
* **Partnership:** Co‑design on‑Country programs; cultural exchange.

---

## 9) Photo guidance (authentic & approachable)

* Real crews; real sites; Elders present where appropriate.
* Candid > posed; show **competence** and **pride** (not deficit).
* One full‑bleed image every 2 pages.
* Captions: person's name (with consent) + role + place.

---

## 10) Source‑grounded data to reuse (fast reference)

* **Cost & supervision differentials** (QLD 2019–20); charts and tables, including **$1,901/day prison** vs **$223/day community**, plus yearly/interval totals, and diversion saving logic used in the DCYJMA pilot framing. 
* **Reality stats used in current prospectus** (youth justice, OOHC, NEET, school readiness, unemployment cost) for your "Reality" spread—keep the poster design. 
* **Engagement gap** (only **58%** of Indigenous youth fully engaged vs **80%** non‑Indigenous) for the "Challenge" side; also contains a **3‑year ~$3.7m** national scaling plan and program modules (resilience, wellbeing, financial, standards, induction). 
* **Impact credentials** (40,000+ ha; 8 regen projects; 46% herd CAGR; genomics & precision grazing) to back the Rural/On‑Country stream and the impact poster. 
* **Investment framing** (stacked model; 85/10/5 allocations; People‑Planet‑Productivity integration; IRR targets; 900‑calf projection) for investor‑facing appendices.

### Notes on citations & accuracy

* The numbers above are grounded in your uploaded prospectus draft and program papers; retain them **as‑is** or update during final proofing to match any latest state or national data you choose to publish.
* Cost figures and diversion logic come from the Outreach2Outback report; keep the framing consistent with those tables/charts.
